# Dashboard template

## Usage

Simply copy the files into your project, or one of the [example applications](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/tree/master/examples), and import and use the `Dashboard` component.

Note: If you are using the example templates, don't forget to import **material-ui-icons**, which is not part of the core material-ui package:
 ```npm install --save material-ui-icons```
